## <p align="center"> 👋🏽 Data-Driven Strategist | Business Analyst | Insight Architect</p>

I’m not your average analyst. I’m an insight-to-action specialist with 16+ years of multi-industry experience turning data into decisive action. From banking and real estate to marketing, branding, and digital commerce, I’ve built a reputation for cutting through noise and delivering insights that reshape strategy, revenue, and culture.

At the core, I help teams and businesses ask better questions, see around corners, and execute with clarity.
